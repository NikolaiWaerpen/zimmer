I started this project in early December 2021. I did it as a challenge to
myself - I've never before made my own application with both a frontend and
backend under my own name. As well as a challenge it is a great playground to
experiment with new exciting technologies I am interested in learning. This blog is a
great example of exactly that. I wanted to learn [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and to
integrate it in a React app. Through the power of MDX I can write markdown, as well as include
JSX in the markdown. Check out the button below!

<Button onClick={() => alert("Yay!")}>It's interactive!</Button>

Isn't that super cool?

## Project plan

This is supposed to be no average developer portfolio site. It is supposed to serve as
a place for me to learn, share my learning process in public (through this blog) as well as
being able to show off the work I do during my learning process on the site itself!
Instead of listing a bunch of things I say I've done I can instead show it off with full
transparancy and have interactive demos at the same time! If this were an average portfolio
the techstack I've landed on would be waaaay overkill, but for my use-case it is perfect (hopefully - we'll
see if it scales to all future use-cases ðŸ˜„).

## Github overview

The project is split into two parts:

1. Zimmer (the frontend) - [View the GitHub repo](https://github.com/NikolaiWaerpen/zimmer)
2. Keller (the backend) - [View the GitHub repo](https://github.com/NikolaiWaerpen/keller)

## Technology overview

Here are the services this site uses:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard): For the frontend deployment & hosting
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): For the backend hosting, deployment as well as DB hosting
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerize the backend for easier deployment

## Technologies I want to integrate in the future

- [Cypress](https://cypress.io): E2E testing framework
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io): Unit/Component testing framework
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com): Simple utilities for testing
  DOM-based user interfaces
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io): Fantastic tool for mocking HTTP requests in the
  browser/node
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): Great React Animation library
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): In-memory databaseâ€“key/value store.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/): For simplifying working with external REST APIs
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/): Easier TypeScript monorepos

## Conclusion

I can't tell you how much I've learned from building this website. It's been a
ton of fun and I'm excited to put my learnings into blog posts to
teach you the specifics of how I did this stuff so you can do it too. The project is
constantly changing, so it'll be exciting to look at this post in a couple of months.
