I always want to get better. Not because I think thats the "right" thing to do, but because it is intrinsic to my nature.
In this case, specifically, I want to get better at programming, and "up my level" as a developer. My plan to accomplish this is to attack my weaknesses.
Here is how I will execute this in practice:

1. Identify the weakness
2. Write it down
3. Explore ways to specifically target what I want to improve on
4. Practice, practice, practice

A trap I want to avoid is identifying weaknesses that are not neccessarily important. Such as closures in JavaScript for example.
If I google the concept, I will remember what it's all about, but I would not be able to recite how it works off the top of my head. Closures seem to be a common way to gauge ones level of compentance within JS (since they are idiomatic to the language), but are they really that useful?
I can't think of many (if any) situations where the knowledge of closures will improve the solutions I create in my day to day work. I learn programming to solve real world problems and to build things.
I only want to focus on acquiring skills that make me more a more efficient problem solver, not grind leetcode problems. Closures may be a bad example, and might be very useful, but I digress.

I have therefore attempted to only focus on the weaknesses that I deem currently relevant.

## Things I want to get better at in 2022 (in no particular order)

- More advanced TypeScript concepts
- SQL
- Memorize all higher order JS functions on both object and primitve data types
- Get a really good understanding of the [event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
- Basic data structures & some sorting algorithms
- Master [Async/Await](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3tm0quoqE&t=275s)
- GraphQL WITHOUT abstraction layers
- Grasp the ins-and-outs of Prisma
- More on object-oriented JavaScript
- [SOLID design principles](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH9kocFX7R7BAe_CvvOCO_p9)
- [Clean code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH-xGQ-nQ87rXI7QkM6W3E79)

## Inspiration

My inspiration for writing this down came from this [excellent video](https://youtu.be/mw0LGzIKvoo) by Andy Sterkowitz.

## Conclusion

This is more or less a note-to-self to remind myself what I want to focus on. By making this information public I am sharing my process and forcing myself to a greater extent to prioritize this.

I might change focus as I get better. This is a work in progress.
