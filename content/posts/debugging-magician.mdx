I don't know about you, but my code rarely works on the first try (and if it does I immediately get suspicious). What do you do when you need to start debugging your code to ensure its doing exactly what you want it to? You are `console.log`ing it!

In this article I'm going to explore a few tips and tricks that will greatly improve your debugging to take you to the next level as a JavaScript developer.

## console.time

This method is used to time how long it takes to run a piece of code. It's a very useful tool to leverage when testing the performance of your code.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    console.time("timer");
    
    setTimeout(() => console.timeEnd("timer"), 2000);
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Which will give the following result:

_Notice the extra 3.8 ms it took to actually fire the function_

## Destructuring

By leveraging the power of destructuring we can easily extract the various methods the `console` object provides. This is useful for keeping your code DRY.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const { log, warn, error } = console;
    
    try {
      log("Hello mom!");
    } catch (error) {
      error("Something went wrong");
    }
    warn("Code finished executing");
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

> Also, in code example we used the three most basic methods that the `console` object provides: `log`, `warn` and `error`. These can be useful for providing more valuable feedback when debugging your code.

You can also rename the methods to something potentially more meaningful:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const { log: logMessage, warn: warnMessage, error: errorMessage } = console;
    
    try {
      logMessage("Hello mom!");
    } catch (error) {
      errorMessage("Something went wrong");
    }
    warnMessage("Code finished executing");
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## console.assert

The `assert` method is used to assert that a condition is true. If it is true, nothing will be logged, however if it's not true, an error will be displayed in the console.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const one = 1;
    const emptyArray = [];
  
    console.assert(one === one, "one is equal to one");
    console.assert(one === emptyArray, "one is equal to emptyArray");
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Which will give the following result:

## console.count

This method is used to count the number of times a piece of code is executed. This is much better than writing something like `console.log(`fired ${count} times`)` for example.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const { count } = console; // notice the use of destructuring to simplify the loop
    
    for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
      x % 2 ? count("odd") : count("even");
    };
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## console.table

Useful to better display arrays and objects.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    console.table(array);
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## console.trace

This method shows exactly where it was fired in the code.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    function foo() {
      function bar() {
        console.trace();
      };
      
      bar();
    }
    
    foo();
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## console.group & console.groupCollapsed

Have you ever gone so far down the debugging hole that the had logging all over and you had no idea which ones were called when and where?  
If this sounds like a familiar situation, consider using this method next time!

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const { group, groupEnd, log } = console; 
  
    group('roles');
    log('administrator');
    log('user');
    log('guest');
    groupEnd();
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

![group](/images/article/group.png)

If you have a lot of groups it might not always be desirable to see all the logs within the groups.
You can use the `groupCollapsed` method instead to immediately collapse the group and tidy up your console.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    const { groupCollapsed, groupEnd, log } = console; 
  
    // ... some groups
    
    groupCollapsed('roles');
    log('administrator');
    log('user');
    log('guest');
    groupEnd();
    
    // ... some more groups
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Debugger

After console.log, debugger is my favorite quick and dirty debugging tool.
If you place a debugger; line in your code, Chrome will automatically stop there when executing.
You can even wrap it in conditionals, so it only runs when you need it.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
  {`
    function somePotentiallyBuggyCode() {
      const somethingFailed = Math.random() > 0.5;
      
      if (somethingFailed) debugger;
    }
    
    somePotentiallyBuggyCode();
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
